# ImageRecognizer
An image recognizer in Java using Machine Learning.

This is one of my first projects using Machine Learning, I wasn't too great at organizing and optimizing code, so this is quite messy, but I'm working on it.

Using this is simple, you first need a folder in your "Pictures" library called "ImageRecognizer". Inside that folder, you're going to want to make multiple folders for what objects you'd want to recognize in images (i.e. "Giraffe"). Inside that folder, you put the images matching the object.

After setting up the database, you will need to train the network. To do this, open the JAR and go to the training tab and if you need, adjust the settings in the settings tab. Click the train button and it should start training and give you a progress bar to track its progress.

Once you have done that, you can move on to using it. Go to the testing tab, choose an image to test, and press the "What is this?" button.
